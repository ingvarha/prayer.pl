PRAYER:

my $Lord = my $shepherd;
my $wants = {};

for ( ever, 
let, me ) { sleep in,
green, pastures
and send me, beside, 
still, waters 
and my $soul = restored; }

send me, 
in, righteousness; 
for ( your, names, sake ) {

do stay if I;
seek ( death and shadow 
and I, shall, 
fear ); not evil; 
for ( $you = with, me, your ) 
{ rod and $staff = my $comfort }

for ( me, prepare, a ){table};
in; the; presence;
of; my $enemies and
anoint; my $head; with oil
until my $cup, overruns;

Goodness and mercy; 
shall follow me 
until all, days
and I; do last } 
for (ever and ever, 
in, Gods ) { house }
